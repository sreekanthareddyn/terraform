Compute Instance with Public IP Address Reservation on an IP Network Interface
This is for the creation of a compute instance with the Public IP address assigned to the IP Network interface.

The Terraform configuration creates the following resources:

IP Network my-ip-network
IP Address Reservation my-ip-address for an public IP address reservation on the IP Network
Compute Instance my-instance OL 7.6 UEK4 instance with one interface on the IP Network associated to the Public IP Address reservation.
SSH Key my-ssh-key for SSH access the instance (defaults to ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)
Access Control List my-acl for associating the security rules to the Virtual NIC Set
Security Rule Allow-ssh-ingress to allow ingress SSH traffic
Security Rule Allow-all-egress to allow all outbound traffic
Security Protocol all to match all traffic
Security Protocol ssh to match ssh traffic to TCP port 22
Virtual NIC Set my-vnic-set to associate instance interfaces to the ACL
